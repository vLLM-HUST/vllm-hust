"""Default-off typed events for request lifecycle instrumentation.

This module provides a process-local typed event outlet for the vLLM
scheduler. It is intentionally generic: it exposes request-level lifecycle
events (a request finished, a request was preempted, its KV state was
actually reclaimed) with no experiment- or product-specific semantics.
Out-of-tree consumers (e.g. context-lifecycle management plugins) register a
sink via :meth:`EventBus.register_sink` and receive typed events; with no
sink registered the bus is disabled and every :meth:`EventBus.emit` is a
single no-op guard, so serving overhead is zero.

This is the request/session-level counterpart of the worker-level
``AsyncOutput*`` lifecycle events. The two layers are orthogonal: worker
events describe output-token movement on the GPU path; these events describe
request admission/finish and KV reclamation at the scheduler.

Event timing contract (enforced by ``tests/v1/test_request_lifecycle_events.py``):

* :class:`RequestFinished` - emitted by ``Scheduler._free_request`` *after*
  the encoder cache has been released and, unless an async connector asked
  for a delayed release, after the KV blocks have been returned. The
  ``kv_reclaim_deferred`` flag is ``True`` in the delayed case: the request
  is finished but its blocks are still owned by the connector. The matching
  :class:`RequestKvReclaimed` arrives later, when the fence step completes.
* :class:`RequestPreempted` - emitted by ``Scheduler._preempt_request`` after
  the preemption has released (or scheduled the deferred release of) the
  request's KV blocks and the request has been put back on the waiting
  queue. This event describes the *scheduling decision*; it is not a claim
  that the KV was returned to the pool.
* :class:`RequestKvReclaimed` - emitted at the exact point the blocks are
  handed back to the block pool, with ``path="immediate"`` for the
  synchronous path and ``path="deferred"`` when a deferred free is drained.
  This is the only event whose occurrence means "the KV for this request is
  really gone".

Token accounting is deliberately split into three non-overlapping quantities
so that consumers never have to guess what a single ``tokens`` field
measured: ``prompt_tokens`` (input length), ``output_tokens`` (generated
tokens), and ``sequence_tokens`` (their sum). ``Request.num_computed_tokens``
is intentionally not mixed in: it tracks prefill progress and re-counts
prompt tokens.
